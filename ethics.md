## (Answer before group discussion) Scoring System Rationale  

What are your housing priority scoring criteria? Why did you choose these weights? How do they reflect the goals of fairness, privacy, simplicity, or rewarding effort? Recall that the categories are:

- Class year (1=Freshman, 2=Sophomore, 3=Junior, 4=Senior)
- Graduation status (True/False)
- Credits earned
- Additional questions - what questions did you choose?

Describe your thought process here before the group discussion.

In my opinion, based on the class year is a fair way which means class year is most weight,(Senior > Junior > Sophomre > Freshman). Then, check the student graduation status, if student nearly graduation, they will have higher priority than other student which in the same grade. 
For credits, I think it should not have high weights, we need consider if students have medical or disability needs. 

Additional questions:
1. About internatioal students, if they need higher priority to choose people who have same or similar backgroud or not.
2. About people who has emotional/psychological problems maybe better let them choose single room?
 

## (Answer after group discussion) Similarities and Differences

1. Describe how your scoring system is similar to at least one other system. If there are none like yours, explain why.

We all choose that class year has the most weight.

2. Describe how your scoring system is different from at least one other system. If everyone in your group had the same system, please state that (after checking carefully that there really are no differences).

But we choose reverse orders for class year. Plus, we choose the different weight for graduation status and credits.
